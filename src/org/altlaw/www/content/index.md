# Welcome to AltLaw

---

Welcome to the new **AltLaw**.  We're pleased to announce that the
search engine is once again fully functional.

**Monday, March 30, 2009:** Having trouble finding the list of cases
cited by / citing to each case?  They're still there -- click on the
**"Citations to/from this"** link to the right of a case, and you'll
get a [page like this](/v1/cases/402397/citations).

**Thursday, March 26, 2009:** If you're interested in downloading the
entire case law collection that AltLaw uses, check out
[bulk.altlaw.org](http://bulk.altlaw.org/).

**Thursday, March 19, 2009:** Just a note: the database of cases has
not yet been updated with new cases from 2009.  We are working on this
as fast as we can!  Daily updates will be back again <del>within two
weeks.</del> soon!

**Monday, March 16, 2009:** The [Advanced Search](/v1/search/advanced)
feature is back!  Give it a spin, and
[let us know](/v1/about/feedback) if you have any problems.
