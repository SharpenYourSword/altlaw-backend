# Case Coverage
---

AltLaw's database contains case law from the following periods:

* United States Supreme Court:
  * Cases from 1803 to the present
* United States Circuit Courts of Appeal:
  * Published cases from 1950 to the present
  * Unpublished cases from 1996 to the present

Which translates to the following reporter volumes:

* United States Reporter (U.S.): volumes 1 to 544
* Federal Reporter, Third Series (F.3d): volumes 1 to 491
* Federal Reporter, Second Series (F.2d): volumes 178 to 999

**Coverage is incomplete for all courts and all time periods!** We
cannot guarantee that we have every important case in the periods
above.  In fact, we know that at least a few cases are missing.

We can only use sources that are 100% public domain.  Unfortunately,
large swaths of U.S. case law are only available in private,
commercial databases.

*Detailed, court-by-court coverage listings will return soon.*
