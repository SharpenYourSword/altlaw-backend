# Why Is My Case on AltLaw?

---

This page explains what you can do if you object to seeing your case
show up on search engines such as Google and Yahoo.

## All court decisions in the United States are public records.

They have been available on the Internet for many years through
services such as Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis.  However, these commercial
sites are closed to Internet search engines.  AltLaw, because it is
a free site, can be found by search engines, as can other free legal
research sites.

## We do not remove cases from AltLaw.

To do so would compromise our mission to serve as an accurate
reference for United States case law.

## But we will try to keep cases off other search engines.

We will use the [Robots Exclusion Protocol](http://www.robotstxt.org/) 
to request Internet search engines not to index certain cases.  This
does not remove the case, but prevents it from appearing on major
search engines such as Google and Yahoo.

To request that we apply the Protocol to your case, send an email to
<feedback@altlaw.org> with the following information:

* Your name
* Your email address
* The web address (the http://... in your browser) of the case
* The title of the case (e.g. Smith v. Jones)

You will receive an email confirmation when we have processed your
request.

## We will not respond to requests by phone.

Only email requests will receive a response.

## We cannot control other web sites.

If your case appears on other web sites besides AltLaw.org, you must
separately contact those sites, which may have different policies.

## This policy is subject to change in the future.
