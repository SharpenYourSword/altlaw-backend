# About This Site
---

The law is meant to belong to the people, but it can be surprisingly
hard to find.  Case reports, a major part of the laws of the United
States, are hard to get at, and even when on the Internet, rarely
searchable. To get full access you generally need either a library of
law reports, or an expensive subscription to an online database, which
can cost hundreds of dollars per hour.

**AltLaw** is a small effort to change that &mdash; to make the common law a
bit more common. **AltLaw** provides the first free, full-text
searchable database of Supreme Court and Federal Appellate case
reports. It is a resource for attorneys, legal scholars, and the
general public.

## AltLaw Features

* Full text search of the last few decades of appellate and Supreme Court opinions.
* [Advanced search](/v1/search/advanced) options (proximity searching, Boolean, concentration, wildcards, etc.)
* Fast and free
* Updated daily

## AltLaw Limits

* Coverage, for most Circuits, limited to about the last 40 to 50 years
* West Reporter Citations (i.e., 23 F.3d 178) not available for the most recent cases (last 1-2 years)
* As of yet, no state law or district court cases
